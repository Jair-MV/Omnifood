## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Desktop-first
-   Media queries
-   JavaScript (a bit for responsive navigation)

### What I learned

ðŸ’¡ The most valuable part of this project was learning how to **plan and structure a web project from scratch**. The instructor provided a custom design framework that helped me approach the build methodicallyâ€”defining global styles, creating reusable components, and maintaining visual consistency. I also deepened my understanding of semantic HTML and layout techniques with Flexbox and Grid.

### Continued development

-   I want to continue improving my **UI/UX design skills** to create more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
-   Iâ€™m also eager to learn more about **JavaScript**, as well as get started with **React.js** and **Node.js** to build more robust applications.

### Useful resources

-   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) â€“ A go-to reference for documentation, examples, and best practices.
